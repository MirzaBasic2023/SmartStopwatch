# SmartStopwatch
Smart stopwatch which can be used in measuring time required to travel some distance of a moving object. Project is using Arduino Nano along with a Liquid Crystal display.

There are 2 lasers along with a phototransistor (those two are in pair). Triggering START laser, it sends an impulse using a radio transmitter to
the radio receiver. Information is, then, processed and registered by Arduino Nano and race starts. Triggering the START laser after the first trigger is useless (it doesn't bear any fruit). Triggering STOP laser, race stops and the elapsed time is printed on the display.
Project is equiped with monopole antennas that can work up to 100m radius. Also, project is not perfect and has a problem with 
photo sensitivity of transistors.

**Notice: This project produces electromagnetic radiation which can trigger car alarms and be a distraction / obstruction in wireless communication.**
